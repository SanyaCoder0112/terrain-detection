In today’s world terrain identification based on satellite imagery is an integral part of strategic movements for both national security and human development. The problem is that more often than not the satellite images are multi-spectral in nature. Thereby, it poses an intrinsic problem of precise identification of terrain type. As of today there is no software to tackle this problem with enough precision. This is exactly what we propose to do. Our software will precisely detect the terrain type from the multi spectral images. For instance it will be able to depict and differentiate between different types of terrains. This could be a sand desert or a forest. Similarly, it could be a grass land or a rocky terrain. In a similar manner it will identify the difference between a water body and a human dwelling such as a concrete building, per se.  The software will be especially trained for two purposes. The first one is the terrain recognition by using deep learning neural network architecture. The second one is to detect terrain texture such as Rocky, Slippery, Sandy and Marshy from the panchromatic images with respect to the respective multispectral image class. In addition, Convolutional Neural Networking will be utilized to generate the classification map on the different terrain types. 
The terrain and its implicit quality are the fundamental aspects of our physical environment. The physical environment definition, with precision, works as the main motivation of this project. This is what is emerging as a critical aspect in current technology. Thus, this project intends to contribute in advancing technology by providing accurate and timely information. But, that is not all. It intends to improve safety as well. This will require optimizing resource utilization. Our software can be employed by the military and defence agencies for military operations to plan routes, assess the suitability of terrain for troop movements or analyse the terrain quality of the unreachable/inaccessible places. In addition to this, this software can be used during natural disasters like floods, earthquakes or landslide in order to detect the terrain which could help the emergency responders assess the impact, and accordingly plan rescue operations. Further our software finds its way in robotics as well. Robots and drones use terrain detection to navigate complex environments, such as forests, urban areas, or disaster zones. Information about a terrain class is valuable for mobile robots, as it can improve their motion control algorithm performance through the use of information about surface properties. Furthermore, it can be employed for agriculture related activities as well as for surveying and mapping. In agriculture, it will help to optimize farming practices by analyzing soil conditions and topography. On the other hand, in surveying and mapping this software will play an essential role to create accurate topographic maps and conduct land surveys. It will also aid in mapping ecosystems and protecting fragile ecosystems by detecting and classifying terrain types. Here, we have highlighted only a few, but many more usage can be found for our software in many other ways. Since, the software classifies the terrain types along with its implicit terrain quality analysis from the images; it provides the rudimentary element for any field that involves analysis of physical environment. Thus, in this project we demonstrate the potential of a more rapid, cost-efficient, and safer approach to predict terrain properties for mobility mapping using satellite imagery with machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
 The software automatically recognizes the terrain type and analyses the texture of the terrain. Input is a combination of multispectral images and panchromatic images received from satellite imagery. A multispectral image is a 	collection of a few image layers of the same scene, each of them acquired at a particular wavelength band. The well-known high-resolution visible sensor operates in the 3-band multispectral image. It detects radiations in the following three wavelengths bands: i) Blue (450–515/ 520 nm and near infrared (NIR), 750–900 nm) which comprises the B band ii) Green (515/520–590/600 nm) which comprises the G and iii) Red (600/630–680/690 nm) which comprises the R band. The multispectral imaging allows extraction of additional information which, the human eye fails to capture with its visible receptors for red, green and blue. It basically measures light emission. On the other hand, a panchromatic image is a single-band grayscale image with a high spatial resolution that “combines” the information from the visible R, G, and B bands. It yields a single integrated band containing no wavelength-specific information. Panchromatic (PAN) images have a finer spatial resolution than Multispectral (MS) images, capturing more details and finer features on the Earth's surface. Conversely, Multispectral images provide a better spectral resolution. Images with high spatial and spectral resolutions are required to improve image interpretation and pixel- or structure-wise automatic classification. Multispectral image has high spectral resolution and thus  helps in the discrimination of terrain types, whereas panchromatic image having high spatial resolution, helps in identifying textures or determining the accurate shape and boundaries of the different terrains. By making use of panchromatic and multispectral images, the fusion techniques aim at synthesizing multispectral images with a high spatial resolution. Thus, the use of both panchromatic and multispectral images in image processing allows for a more comprehensive and accurate analysis of satellite images. This allows for better terrain detection and terrain texture analysis. Thus, our approach using both panchromatic and multispectral images provides a better solution than software using only the RGB images for analysis.
Once done with data collection, our next step would be filtering and pre-processing of the data, one of the fundamental steps in image processing. These steps involve various techniques and methods tailored to specific goals. Here's an overview of filtering and preprocessing in image processing: i) Image Enhancement:  Adjusting the contrast of an image to make it visually more appealing and improve the visibility of details. And changing the overall brightness to make the image brighter or darker. ii) Noise Reduction: For salt-and-pepper noise or random noise, filters like Gaussian, Median, or Mean can be applied. For more advanced denoising methods such as wavelet denoising means filtering to remove various types of noise while preserving edges and details iii) Sharpening: Enhancing edges and fine details in the image using filters like Laplacian or gradient operators. iv) Image Smoothing: Using Low-pass Filters like Gaussian or box filters to Reduce noise and enhance details. v)  Geometric Transformations: Scaling, Rotation, and Translation: Adjusting the size, orientation, and position of the image. vi) Feature Extraction: Identifying and extracting specific features or regions of interest (ROI) in the image, such as edges, corners, and blobs. vii) Image Registration: Aligning multiple images to a common reference frame, which is essential for tasks like image stitching and change detection. viii) Image Segmentation: Dividing an image into meaningful regions or objects to facilitate object recognition and analysis ix) Data Annotation: Labelling data with different metadata forms like text, i.e., different terrain types to train the deep learning neural network model. Then, the processed data is divided into two groups of panchromatic and multispectral images respectively. 
The processed multispectral data is divided into three groups. One group (e.g., ~70%) is used for training the CNN model. Then, another one group (e.g., ~20%) is used for testing the functioning of our model. Finally, the rest (e.g., ~10%) of the data is used for validation. The validation set is used to monitor the model's performance during training. The training sample generated contains labelled sample images of distinct classes, such as forest, grassland, concrete, water body, sand, and rock. In our proposed approach, we intend to use Supervised Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the recognition of distinct terrains. Because, it offers several advantages for tasks that require labelled data and are primarily used for classification and regression. One of these is the high accuracy it provides in various classification. Also, CNNs can automatically learn relevant features from the data, eliminating the need for handcrafted feature engineering. One of the most advantageous things about CNN is its robustness. They can handle variations in data, such as different orientations, density and occlusions. This robustness is particularly useful in terrain detection as it varies from one type of terrain to the other. For example, a forest terrain is shown as dark and dense. On the other hand, the grassland terrain is shown in a lighter and distributed manner. 
Now, the neural network model will be created using a deep learning framework such as PyTorch, or Keras. The CNN architecture will be defined including the number of layers, filter sizes, and activation functions. For loss function, we can use cross-entropy loss since multiple class problem is there. As an optimizer Adam can be used to update the model's weights during training. Next, we train our model by feeding batches of the generated training sample images into the network. While training, we need to minimize the loss using backpropagation and optimization. Also, we need to monitor the accuracy and loss on both the training and validation sets to detect overfitting or underfitting. To prevent overfitting, regularization techniques such as dropout and batch normalization can be implemented. In order to improve the model’s performance, fine-tune hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and regularization strength will be adjusted accordingly. 
After training, we will evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset that it has never seen before. This provides an unbiased assessment of its generalization capabilities. Once we are satisfied with the model's performance, we can deploy it for inference on new data. Thus, the classification map or the multispectral image can be extracted now.
Next step is registration of a panchromatic image with the multispectral image(classification map generated). This step involves aligning the classification map with the panchromatic image so that each pixel in the classification map corresponds to the same geographic location as its counterpart in the panchromatic image. This registration process is essential for analysing the two images (i.e., multispectral and panchromatic) together. The registration process begins with preprocessing. But since it's already done, we can move onto the next step i.e., Resampling. It is required because the panchromatic image and classification map have different resolutions. So, the panchromatic images need to be resampled to match the resolution of the other. This ensures that the pixels in both images correspond correctly. Next, we might need to perform geometric transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling to align the classification map with the panchromatic image. These transformations depend on the initial misalignment between the images. Further, image registration software or algorithms can be used to automate the process of aligning the classification map with the panchromatic image. Some commonly used techniques include feature-based registration (matching key points or control points), intensity-based registration, and mutual information-based registration. After performing the initial registration, we will visually assess the alignment of the classification map with the panchromatic image. If needed we will make adjustments to ensure the best alignment. Once the registration is satisfactory, we proceed with the texture analysis task on the registered panchromatic data. 
The implicit quality analysis of the terrain will be done using Fractal dimension measurement. Fractal dimension is a mathematical concept used in texture analysis to quantify the complexity or roughness of textures. It is particularly useful for characterizing natural and irregular textures, such as those found in landscapes, biological tissues, or materials. The fractal dimension describes how patterns or textures change at different scales within an image. To use fractal dimension in texture analysis, the first step is image segmentation, i.e., to segment the image, and isolating the texture of interest from the background or other structures. Secondly, fractal dimension analysis involves examining the texture at multiple scales. This can be done by iteratively applying filters or analysing the texture at different levels of detail. Common methods include box-counting, multi-fractal analysis, or wavelet analysis. Now, we would need to calculate the fractal dimension, depending on the chosen approach. One common method is the box-counting dimension, which involves dividing the image into a grid of boxes and counting the number of boxes that contain some part of the texture at each scale. The fractal dimension is then estimated based on how the number of boxes changes with scale. Finally, the calculated fractal dimension provides a measure of the roughness or self-similarity of the texture. A higher fractal dimension indicates greater complexity or roughness, while a lower dimension implies smoother textures. Thus, depending on the fractal dimension the software will output the terrain texture as rocky, slippery, marshy or sandy. 
Thus, the software will recognize the terrain type from the multispectral image. Followed by the terrain texture analysis from the registered panchromatic image. Overall, it provides one of the most fundamental aspects of information required to inspect any kind of physical environment for any purpose. 
Even though, this approach gives a better performance than the approaches using RGB images. The availability of multispectral and panchromatic image in pair of the same place is very less, especially for the places within India. Multispectral image is needed for terrain recognition whereas panchromatic image is needed to detect the texture of the terrain. Both in set for places in India are hardly available. But for now, we have collected some data. Our data includes multispectral and panchromatic images of Bikaner, Dehradun, Kolkata and Mumbai. It comprises of almost all the types of terrains, over which we are planning to train our model.
